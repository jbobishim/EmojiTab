The project is a beta version of EmojiTab. It consists of multiple HTML files, such as 
index.html
 and 
result.html
, where users can interact with a web interface that allows them to search for emojis. The 
index.html
 file contains a search form to input a search term, and upon submitting the form, it redirects the user to the 
result.html
 page where a grid of emojis is displayed. The emojis are randomly generated from a predefined set of emojis. Additionally, there is a button on the 
result.html
 page that links back to the 
index.html
 page. The project seems to focus on creating a simple and interactive web experience centered around emojis.
